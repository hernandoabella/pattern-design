# Patrones de Dise√±o

Design patterns are optimized, reusable solutions to the programming problems that we encounter every day.

a design pattern is a description, or template, for how to solve a problem that can be used in may different situations. it's not a language-specific. A good design pattern should be implementable in most if not all languages, depending on the capabilities of the language.

there are three basic kinds of design patterns:

creational

abstract factory, builder, factory method, object pool, prototype, singleton.

structural

adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, proxy.

behavioral

chain of responsibility, command, interpreter, iterator, mediator, memento, observer, state, strategy, template method, visitor.

generally, the three groups above define how your program eleemnts relate to each other, how they gt created, and how they communicate with each other.

why use them?

design patterns are well-thought out solutions to programming problems. let's draw a parallel with a real-world example. suppose you are standing at the base of a mountain and have been given the task of reaching its top by the end of the day. assuming that you are unaware of the available routes to the montain top0, what will you do? of course, you will start to climb up as per you own understanding. your lack of knowledge about the right route makes it extremely difficult for you to decide the beest possible route.

if somebody gives you a detailed map along with all posible routes, including the pros and cons of each, then you will be in a much better position to begin your journey and choose the right route.

simply put a design pattern is a proven solution to solve design problems.
